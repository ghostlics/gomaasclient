## Usage

Using the Go MAAS Client is straightforward. Below is a basic example of how to use the client to interact with the MAAS API.

### Basic Example

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/ghostlics/gomaasclient"
)

func main() {
    client := gomaasclient.New("http://your-maas-server/MAAS/api/2.0", "your-api-key")

    machines, err := client.ListMachines()
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
        return
    }

    for _, machine := range machines {
        fmt.Println("Machine:", machine)
    }
}
```

### Configuration

To configure the client, you need to set the MAAS server URL and your API key. You can do this directly in the code or through environment variables.

### Advanced Usage

The Go MAAS Client also supports advanced features such as:

- **Creating and deleting machines**
